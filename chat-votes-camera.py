# chat-votes-camera.py
# This script fetches the name of an OBS scene from a remote server. If the
# name matches a scene in the current configuration, OBS switches to that
# scene. The intention is for the chat to vote twitch-plays-pokemon style on
# which view of they want, and automation shows them that view. This seems
# primarily useful for creative streamers.
